If you do get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to me or a classmate. \n",

The [arcpy](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) library is proprietary and provides the full suite of functions that exist within ArcPro (or if it doesn't, I haven't found that yet). The [arcgis](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) library provides a subset of that functinoality, but is completely free. We will use both of these libraries throughout the semester, but in this notebook, we will only focus on arcpy.\n",
