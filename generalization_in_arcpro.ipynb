    "\n",
    "Esri provides amazing functionality through their two libraries, `arcpy` and `arcgis`. The [arcpy](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) library is proprietary and provides the full suite of functions that exist within ArcPro (or if it doesn't, I haven't found that yet). The [arcgis](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) library provides a subset of that functinoality, but is completely free. In this notebook, we will only focus on arcpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. Be able to call functions from `arcpy` through Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    - be able to set environment workspace\n",
    "    - understand `arcpy` is a library that needs to be imported\n",
    "    - be able to use help documentation to understand function syntax\n",
    "2. Reflect on Jupyter; compare and contrast with accessing GIS through Pro"

    "1. Jupyter notebook is a more complicated way of running tool and analyzing data than ArcPro, which would be more difficult for the new learners.\n",
